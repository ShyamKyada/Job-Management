# Job Management App

A simple and efficient web app to manage job orders, update progress, and automatically group delivered jobs — built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** with localStorage persistence.

## 🧠 Concepts Used

✔ DOM Manipulation  
✔ Event Handling  
✔ Array Methods (`map`, `filter`, `splice`)  
✔ LocalStorage CRUD (Save, Read, Update, Delete)  
✔ Template Literals for dynamic UI rendering  
✔ Conditional Rendering (Active vs Delivered jobs)  
✔ Separation of UI & Logic Functions  
✔ Re-rendering without page refresh  
✔ Responsive layout (CSS Flex + Table)

## ✨ Features

✅ Add jobs with Party Name, Job Name, Date, Status  
✅ Update status anytime (inline dropdown in table)  
✅ Jobs marked as **Delivered** move automatically to a separate section  
✅ Delete jobs from either list  
✅ Data is saved in browser using `localStorage`  
✅ Toast notifications for all actions  
✅ Fully responsive dark UI design
